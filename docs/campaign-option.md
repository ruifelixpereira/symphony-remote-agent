# Remote agent deployment scenario using a Campaign

In this scenario, application deployment is carried out using a Symphony `campaign`. 

## Generic flow

1. Define your application as a Symphony `solution` object and your deployment target as a Symphony `target` object.

1. Define your deployment topology as a Symphony `instance` object wrapped in a Symphony `catalog` object. 
    > **Note:** We use a catalog object instead of an instance object here because an instance object represents a desired state, which will trigger Symphony state reconciliation. In this case, however, we donâ€™t want the state reconciliation to be triggered immediately. Hence, we capture the "intention of the desired state" in a catalog object. The intention will be "materialized" into an instance object only after the campaign is activated.

1. Define a Symphony `campaign` object that can execute several steps, including the `materialization` of an instance, and then drives application deployment.

1. Create an `activation` object to activate the campaign.


## Sample artifacts
You can find sample artifacts in this repository under the `remote-campaign` folder:
| Artifact | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| [activation.json](../remote-campaign/activation.json) | Campaign activation |
| [campaign.json](../remote-campaign/campaign.json) | Campaign definition |
| [instance-catalog.json](../remote-campaign/instance-catalog.json) | Instance definition (wrapped in a catalog) |
| [solution.json](../remote-campaign/solution.json) | Solution definition |
| [target.json](../remote-campaign/target.json) | Target definition |
| [s01-deploy-objects.sh](../remote-campaign/s01-deploy-objects.sh) | Shell script that deploys Symphony objects for target, solution, instance catalog and campaign (making REST calls to the Symphony API control plane) |
| [s02-activate-campaign.sh](../remote-campaign/s02-activate-campaign.sh) | Shell script that activates the campaign (making REST calls to the Symphony API control plane) |
| [s03-validate-instance.sh](../remote-campaign/s03-validate-instance.sh) | Shell script that lists the defined instances (making REST calls to the Symphony API control plane) |

## Deployment steps

1. Edit Symphony target object in `target.json` and change `<YOUR REMOTE VM IP>` to the IP address of your remote VM running the Symphony agent.

1. Create Symphony objects using the provided shell script (make sure you validate if the variable `SYMPHONY_BASE_URL` defined in the script is pointing to your Symphony API control plane):
    ```bash
    ./s01-deploy-objects.sh
    ```

1. Activate the campaign (make sure you validate if the variable `SYMPHONY_BASE_URL` defined in the script is pointing to your Symphony API control plane):
    ```bash
    ./s02-activate-campaign.sh
    ```

1. Observe the instance is created and the sample application is deployed (make sure you validate if the variable `SYMPHONY_BASE_URL` defined in the script is pointing to your Symphony API control plane):
    ```bash
    ./s03-validate-instance.sh # gets all instances

    [{"metadata":{"namespace":"default","name":"target-runtime-remote-campaign-cmd-instance"},"spec":{"solution":"target-runtime-remote-campaign-cmd-solution","target":{"name":"remote-cmd"},"generation":"1"},"status":{"provisioningStatus":{"operationId":"","status":"","error":{}},"lastModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}]

    cat /tmp/hello_campaign # the solution actually is just a shell command appending a line to this file

    ...
    ```
